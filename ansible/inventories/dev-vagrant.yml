      # Dev environment specifics
      # Vagrant doesn't have a GPU access and Sunshine default to KMS capture
      # which somehow fails in Vagrant VM + container and make X11 and desktop crash
      # for unknown reason.
      #
      # This is related to /dev/dri* access: when Sunshine doesn't have access to
      # /dev/dri* it will fallback to X11 capture as it can't read it, but since
      # Sunshine user has access to /dev/* it will try to use KMS capture which make
      # use of DRI. This somehow crash the X11 and desktop process for unknown reason.
      # Forcing to use X11 capture workaround the issue.
