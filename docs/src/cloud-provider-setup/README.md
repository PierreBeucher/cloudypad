# Cloud provider setup

Cloud provider accounts may require some setup before you can your deploy Cloudy Pad instance.

Typical needs:
- **Create your Cloud provider account** - If not already done, you'll need to create an account on the Cloud provider you want to use. 
- **Configure your Cloud provider credentials** - they are required by Cloudy Pad to create your instance.
- **Define Quotas** allowing you to deploy GPU - Most Cloud providers require a "quota increase" before allowing you to deploy GPU instances suitable for Cloud gaming. 
- **Profile verification** - for new accounts, some Cloud provider may require some kind of verification. 

_Note: future version of Cloudy Pad will automate away most of this setup for you._
