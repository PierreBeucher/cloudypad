# Google Cloud Platform costs

## Monthly cost estimations

Cloudy-Pad is free and open-source; however, charges may apply when using a Cloud provider. Typically billed resources:
- Machine usage (GPU, CPU, RAM)
- Disk storage
- IP address reservation

**ðŸ’¸ It's recommenced to use Spot instances as they are 30% to 90% cheaper !** As Spot instances interrupton is generally low, you probably won't get interruped during your session. However, make sure to save often nonetheless ðŸ˜‰

Example: using a n1-standard-4 (15 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, NVIDIA T4) Spot instance with 100 GB disk for 10 hours / month would cost approximatively 11.54$ / month.

## Egress costs - Data transfer out from Google to Internet

Google bills data transfer out to internet past a **200GB free data threshold**. As Cloudy Pad streams from Google to your machine via internet, you may be billed for data transfer past a certain usage. [Google bills 0.085$ per GB](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing#vpc-pricing) up to 10 TB after the free threshold. 

Considering a 1080p 60 FPS stream, data transfer would be around 2.25 GB/hr. **Past 90 or 100 hours per month**, Google may start billing additional data transfer charges:

| Time played / month (h) |   10  |   20  |   40  |   80   |   90   |   100  |   150  |
|:-----------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   Data transfered (GB)  | 22.50 | 45.00 | 90.00 | 180.00 | 202.50 | 225.00 | 337.50 |
