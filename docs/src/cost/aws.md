# AWS costs

## Monthly cost estimations

Cloudy-Pad is free and open-source; however, charges may apply when using a Cloud provider. Typically billed resources:
- Machine usage (GPU, CPU, RAM)
- Disk storage
- IP address reservation

**ðŸ’¸ It's recommenced to use Spot instances as they are 30% to 90% cheaper !** As Spot instances interrupton is generally low, you probably won't get interruped during your session. However, make sure to save often nonetheless ðŸ˜‰

Example: using a g4dn.xlarge (16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, NVIDIA T4) Spot instance for 10 hours / month would cost approximatively 9.63$ / month.

## Egress costs - Data transfer out from Amazon to Internet

AWS bills data transfer out to internet past a 100GB free data threshold. As Cloudy Pad streams from AWS to your machine via internet, you may be billed for data transfer past a certain usage. [AWS bills 0.09$ per GB in most regions](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer) up to 10 TB after the free threshold. 

**Past 40 or 50 hours per month**, AWS may start billing additional data transfer charges. 

Considering a 1080p 60 FPS stream, data transfer would be around 2.25 GB/hr @ 5 Mbps, incuring additional cost depending on time played:

| Time played / month (h) |   10  |   20  |   40  |   44  |   50   |   60   |   100  |
|:-----------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   Data transfered (GB)  | 22.50 | 45.00 | 90.00 | 99.00 | 112.50 | 135.00 | 225.00 |
|        Cost  ($)        | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 |  $1.13 |  $3.15 | $11.25 |
