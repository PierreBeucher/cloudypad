/!\ CHANGES MADE WITH sudo COMMANDS MAY NOT PERSIST /!\

You *can* run sudo command in Cloudy Pad but be aware:

Cloudy Pad runs inside a container. This means that any packages
you install or system updates you make outside of standard usage
may NOT persist: the container is re-created every time your 
instance starts.

If you know what you are doing, go ahead! We'd actually love to hear
about your sudo use cases: share them on Discord or GitHub so we can
consider integrating them natively in Cloudy Pad. 

Keep in mind: sudo commands can break things, and we may not be
able to provide support for issues caused by sudo-related usage. 

Persistent data can be stored under $XDG_DATA_HOME, this folder and its 
contents will persist across sessions. This folder contains your games 
and user data - be careful not to break anything important!

Your sudo password is:

    $CLOUDYPAD_USER_PASSWORD

Alternatively, use get-cloudy-password command to show your sudo password.
