Cloudy Pad lets you **deploy a Cloud gaming instance on your own servers, machines or directly in the Cloud** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Scaleway...) and **play your own Steam, Epic, GOG and other games** - without requiring a powerful gaming machine or a costly subscription.

**Not familiar with Cloud Gaming ?** See [What's Cloud Gaming and how is Cloudy Pad useful ?](./docs/src/what-is-cloud-gaming.md)
