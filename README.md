Cloudy Pad is a Free, Open Source alternative to GeForce Now, Blacknut and similar Cloud Gaming platforms. It lets you deploy a Cloud gaming server like [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) anywhere in the world and play your own games - without requiring a powerful gaming machine or a costly subscription:

- Stream with **[Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)** client
- Run your games through **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)**, **[Pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org/)** or **[Lutris](https://lutris.net/)**
- Deploy on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Azure** or **Paperspace**
- **No screen or virtual screen needed.** Cloudy Pad manages it all for you !
- Setup automated **Cost alerts** to avoid overspending ðŸ’¸
- Use **Spot instances** for up to **90% cheaper** instances
- Play **30 hours per month** for **~15$ / month or less**
- **Pay by the hour, no subscription** required
- Streaming server: choose between [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and [Wolf](https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/)

## Development status ðŸ§ª

This project is still at an experimental phase. While working and allowing you to play in the Cloud seamlessly, there may be breaking changes in the future. **Your feedback, bug reports and contribution will be greatly appreciated !**

## Getting started ðŸš€

Not familiar with terms like _"Cloud gaming"_, _"Moonlight"_, _"Cloud Provider"_ _"terminal"_ or _"CLI"_ ? Visit [What's Cloud Gaming and how is Cloudy Pad useful ?](https://cloudypad.gg/what-is-cloud-gaming) first ðŸ˜‰

### Prerequisites

- A Cloud provider account, one of:
  - AWS
  - Azure
  - Google Cloud
  - Paperspace
- [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) streaming client
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
  - For MacOS, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is recommended over Docker Desktop
  - Rootless Docker and non-Docker engines like Podman are not supported yet

### Installation 

Install latest version of `cloudypad` CLI:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreBeucher/cloudypad/master/install.sh | bash
```

For other installation methods, see [Installation](https://cloudypad.gg/usage/installation)

### Cloud provider setup

You may need to setup a few things on your Cloud provider (eg. API key or SSH key). Checkout [per-Clouder setup specifities](https://cloudypad.gg/cloud-provider-setup).

### Deploy your instance !

Once ready, create your instance with `cloudypad` CLI:

```sh
cloudypad create
# How shall we name your Cloudy Pad instance? (default: mypad) 
#
# Creating Cloudy Pad instance 'mypad'
#
# [...]
#
# ðŸ¥³ Your Cloudy Pad instance is ready !
```

Cloudy Pad will:
- Prompt important information (eg. machine type, GPU, cost alerts, etc.) 
- Create a new Cloud machine and related configurations automatically (you can also use an existing machine)
- Install GPU drivers and [Wolf gaming server](https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/)
- Help your Pair with Moonlight

### Play your game

Run Moonlight and connect to your instance. Run Steam, login, install your game and enjoy.

To connect with Steam, either:
- Type your login and password directly
- Use Steam smartphone app and scan QR code (run Steam app, log in to your account and click on shield button at the bottom) 

### Stop your instance after gaming sessions

Once you are done, **remember to stop your instance to avoid unnecessary costs ðŸ’¸**

```sh
cloudypad stop mypad
# or 
# cloudypad destroy mypad
```
