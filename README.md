Cloudy Pad is a Free, Open Source alternative to GeForce Now, Blacknut and similar Cloud Gaming platforms. It lets you deploy a Cloud gaming server like [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) anywhere in the world and play your own games - without requiring a powerful gaming machine or a costly subscription:

- Stream with **[Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)** client
- Run your games through **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)**, **[Pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org/)** or **[Lutris](https://lutris.net/)**
- Deploy on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Azure**, **Scaleway** or **Paperspace**
- **No screen or virtual screen needed.** Cloudy Pad manages it all for you !
- Play **30 hours per month** for **~15$ / month or less**
- **Pay by the hour, no subscription** required
- Streaming server: choose between [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and [Wolf](https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/)
- **Cost reduction** and management 💸 
  - Setup automated **Cost alerts** to avoid overspending 
  - Use **Spot instances** for up to **90% cheaper** instances
  - Automatically shutdown inactive instances
