When you run command, always execute it under a Nix development shell, eg. instead or running directly:

```sh
echo foobar
```

Run nix developc -c COMMAND without quotes:

```sh
nix develop -c echo foobar
# do not use quote, eg. not this: nix develop -c "echo foobar"
```

Most commands can be run as a task from Taskfile.yml at project root, for example checking no obvious thing broke after an update:

```sh
# List all tasks
task -a

# Quick compilation and syntax check
nix develop -c task test-compile

# Unit tests
nix develop -c task test-unit
```
