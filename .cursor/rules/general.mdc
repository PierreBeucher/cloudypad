Most of the time you'll be asked to code:
- Go straight to code. Do not start with "I'm gonna bla bla bla" and do not end with a summary of what you've done. Just write code and update files, no chitchat. 
- Do not summarize what you did. When you finished, no more output - unless I specifically asked for details or a plan
