How to run commands for testing, compilation and other things

## ALWAYS run commands under a Nix development shell

When you run command, ALWAYS execute it under a Nix development shell unless specifically asked otherwise.

Exampple: you are asked to run `task test-unit`, do NOT run directly:

```sh
# Don't run plainly like this
task test-unit
```

Instead, run `nix developc -c [COMMAND]` without quotes:

```sh
nix develop -c task test-unit
# do not use quote, eg. not this: nix develop -c "task test-unit"
```

Nix development shell will provide binaries and environment variables suitable for this project. Without it, you may be mising important tools and binaries. 

## Task files

Most commands can be run as a task from Taskfile.yml at project root, for example checking no obvious thing broke after an update:

```sh
# List all tasks
task -a

# Quick compilation and syntax check
task test-compile

# Unit tests
task test-unit
```

Considering above statement, these must be run as `nix develop -c task ...` of course.
