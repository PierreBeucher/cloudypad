# AI task history

In agent mode, make sure to keep prompt and your task history and actions in `.ai/history`.

Overall goal:
- Give me an understanding of problems encountered and decisions made
- Help me learn from your mistakes and create a mental model of complex tasks being performed

How to keep history:

- For current chat, create a file name like `DATE-CONTEXT.md`, eg. `2026-01-15-15-50-New-K8S-Infrastructure.md`
  - To extract current date, use command `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M"`
- Always write the EXACT given initial prompt for our chat to this file
- As we chat and iterate, add important information to this file: new prompts and context added, summary of task done, summary of issues and how you solved them as you described at end of task

Hsitory file format:

```
# Task title

A short, single sentence task summary.

## Initial iteration

> The initial prompt

### Code changes

A short, single sentence summary of code changes. Don't list files changes, don't go in-depth. Don't describe what is already clear when reading Git history.

### Issues encountered

Describe in-depth the issues you encountered, how you fixed them (in term of command run, how you diagnosed, and why you chose such a solution), so that I can create a mental model of things and complexity happening behind the hood that may not be clear in Git history.

## Iteration 2

> The prompt I gave for second iteration

### Code changes

### Issues encountered

## Iteration 3
